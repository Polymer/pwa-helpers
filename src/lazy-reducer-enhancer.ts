/*
  If you are lazy loading any connected elements, then these elements must be
  able to lazily install their reducers. This is a store enhancer that
  enables that.

  Sample use (where you define your redux store, in store.js):

  import lazyReducerEnhancer from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/lazy-reducer-enhancer.js';
  import someReducer from './reducers/someReducer.js';

  export const store = createStore(
    (state, action) => state,
    compose(lazyReducerEnhancer(combineReducers), applyMiddleware(thunk))
  );

  Then, in your page/element, you can lazy load a specific reducer with:
  store.addReducers({
    someReducer
  });
*/
import * as r from 'redux'

export interface LazyStore {
  addReducers: (newReducers: r.ReducersMapObject) => void
}

export const lazyReducerEnhancer = function(combineReducers: typeof r.combineReducers) {
  const enhancer: r.StoreEnhancer<LazyStore> = (nextCreator) => {
    return (origReducer, preloadedState) => {
      let lazyReducers = {};
      const nextStore = nextCreator(origReducer, preloadedState);
      return {
        ...nextStore,
        addReducers(newReducers) {
          const combinedReducerMap: r.ReducersMapObject = {
            ...lazyReducers,
            ...newReducers
          };

          this.replaceReducer(combineReducers(lazyReducers = combinedReducerMap));
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return enhancer;
}
