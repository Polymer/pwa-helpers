# pwa-helpers
Small helper methods or mixins to help build a PWA,
and reduce the boilerplate you might have to write. There are many different
ways in which you could write these helpers; use these if you want a simple
starting point.

## Basic helpers
These are vanilla JavaScript methods that can be used regardless of which
frameworks or libraries your application is written in.

### `router.js`
This is a basic router that calls a callback whenever the location is updated.

Example (in your top level element or document):
```js
import { installRouter } from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/router.js';

installRouter((location) => console.log(location));
```

### `network.js`
This is a utility method that calls a callback whenever the network connectivity of the app changes.

Example (in your top level element or document):
```js
import { installOfflineWatcher } from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/network.js';

installOfflineWatcher((offline) => {
  console.log(offline ? ' offline' : 'online');
});
```

### `metadata.js`
This is a utility method that updates the page's open graph and Twitter card metadata.

Example (in your top level element or document, or in the router callback):
```js
import { updateMetadata } from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/metadata.js';

updateMetadata({
    title: 'My App - view 1',
    description: 'This is my sample app',
    url: document.location.href,
    image: '/assets/view1-hero.png'
});
```

### `media-query.js`
Utility method that calls a callback whenever a media-query matches in response
to the viewport size changing.

Example:
```js
import { installMediaQueryWatcher } from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/media-query.js';

installMediaQueryWatcher(`(min-width: 600px)`, (matches) => {
  console.log(matches ? 'wide screen' : 'narrow sreen');
});
```

## Test helpers
Utility methods to be used inside of testing frameworks, to reduce some testing boilerplate.

### `axe-report.js`
This is an [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) reporter that returns an
Error containing every a11y violation for an element. Use this if you want to
include `axe-core` in automated Mocha tests, etc.

Example (in a Mocha test):
```js
import '../node_modules/axe-core/axe.min.js';
import { axeReport } from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/axe-report.js';

describe('button', function() {
  it('is accessible', function() {
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.textContent = 'click this';  // Test should fail without this line.
    return axeReport(button);
  });
});
```

## Redux helpers
These utility methods are useful if your application is using Redux for state management.

### `connect-mixin.js`
This is a JavaScript mixin that you can use to connect a Custom Element base class
to a Redux store. You can implement `mapStateToProps(state)` and
`mapDispatchToProps(dispatch)` methods to connect the element to the store.

```js
import { connect } from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/connect-mixin.js';

class MyElement extends connect(store)(HTMLElement) {
  // ...

  mapStateToProps(state) {
    return {
      count: state.data.count
    };
  }

  mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    return {
      onIncrement: count => dispatch(increment(count))
    };
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can implement a `stateChanged(state)` method which is called when
the state is updated. If you implement this method, `mapStateToProps(state)` won't
be used.

```js
import { connect } from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/connect-mixin.js';

class MyElement extends connect(store)(HTMLElement) {
  stateChanged(state) {
    this.textContent = state.data.count.toString();
  }
}
```

### `lazy-reducer-enhancer.js`
A Redux store enhancer that lets you lazy-install reducers after the store
has booted up. Use this if your application lazy-loads routes that are connected
to a Redux store.

Example (in your store code):
```js
import lazyReducerEnhancer from '../node_modules/pwa-helpers/lazy-reducer-enhancer.js';
import someReducer from './reducers/someReducer.js';

export const store = createStore(
  (state, action) => state,
  compose(lazyReducerEnhancer(combineReducers), applyMiddleware(thunk))
);
// An initial, lazy-loaded reducer. Use this for any other lazy reducers in elements as well.
store.addReducers({
  someReducer
});
```
